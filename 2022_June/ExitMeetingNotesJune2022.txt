Hybrid in person + virtual meeting

- Scribe: Adam Leache (EVP)

Attendance: in-person (8), virtual (12)
Current membership: 668 

###Notes
Constitutional change on timing and process for Nominating Committee activities.
- Vote to change specific date to "target date" (pass)
- Vote to accept change to constitution (pass, unanimous)

Joint Meeting Planning for 2023 (Albuquerque, NM)
- Separate virtual and in-person meetings
- Virtual meeting needs more senior faculty involvement
- Tri-societies need to move awards to virtual meeting to incentivize attendance
- Grad reps strongly favor virtual meeting after in-person meeting
- Alternating virtual and in-person meetings is gaining popularity, but we already have contracts for in-person meetings through 2026
- Virtual meeting may happen using zoom to reduce cost and increase interactions
- Proposal for SSB to cover virtual meeting registration costs for Mayr finalists

Joint Meeting Planning for 2024 (Montreal, Canada)
- Proposal for 60:40 split between general talk submission and ESEB symposia model

Proposal for "SSB Early Systematist Award"
- Membership grant for students, funding for prelim. research or meeting attendance
- 25 students/year: 3 year membership, $500 funding (research or meeting)
- Early students = <3 year PhD
- SSB cost estimate is $13,775
- Trying to keep administration low by selecting recipients randomly
- Perhaps $500 is insufficient for research funding or travel to a meeting, but it's a tangible benefit
- Develop a form letter for recommenders to reduce effort and time investment
- Vote on stipend increase from $500 to $1000 (yes:17 no:2 abstain:1)

Expanded use of Slack
- Good way to build community at low cost
- Share slack invite with all SSB members
- Could provide structure for getting help with research questions

Approved website funding proposal for SSB stand-alone meeting in Mexico City (2023)

Trustees
- Constitution policy: trustees nominated by president, reappointments every 3 years
- Support for returning to model outlined in constitution
- Proposal to reappoint current trustees, one per year, starting this year
- Postpone decision on wording for next council meeting
