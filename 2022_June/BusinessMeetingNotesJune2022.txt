###Discussion
How to structure Evolution meeting in the future (hybrid virtual/in-person)
-- hybrid format is not favored; virtual participants are left out of in-person experience
-- We have contacts for in-person meetings through 2026
-- Virtual content should be provided each year; adding awards will increase value/participation of virtual meeting
-- Caution that virtual meeting will become "poor cousin" to in-person meeting; attending in-person is a privilege, not everyone can attend.
-- If virtual and inperson meetings occur each year, how far apart should they be? Discussion of different pros and cons. 
-- Suggestion to poll to membership to figure out interest and views on virtual vs. in-person formats
-- Ideas for incentivizing virtual meeting with more networking activities

SSB finances
- How can we spend to grow SSB and support systematics research? 
-- Fund council +  grad reps to attend meeting
-- We need to communicate to new council members that SSB can fund travel to meeting
-- Raise amount of Mayr Award
-- Build capacity to connect SSB with early career college students
-- Awards for undergraduate researchers; research funds and attendance costs
-- NSF-LEAPS proposal would train inclusive mentors to achieve similar training goal
-- Tracy Heath and David Baum volunteer to develop undergraduate research funding model
-- Summer research grants for grad students to visit other labs/departments to diversify training (Mike Landis and Brian O'Meara volunteer to develop the program)
-- Proposal to support TreeBase, which is no longer maintained. SSB could support any number of similar websites or initiates
-- Could give members free color figures in journals

Concerns & Ideas & Questions
-- Graduate student participation needs to increase meaningfully
-- We have ideas and funds, but time is lacking for individuals to perform the work; graduate assistants could help implement programs
-- Pathways to SSB participation need to increase to engage members to join council
-- Advertise SSB more effectively to educate students on who's in the society
-- Faculty profiles are one way to broadly advertise our membership
-- Proposal for SSB slack channels (paid) to retain history/ institutional memory
-- Discussion of discord vs. slack; discord is viewed as more appealing to undergraduates
-- How can we structure payment to grad students to help implement SSB program ideas?
-- David Baum is exploring Associate Management Company to help with SSB administration 
-- Code of Ethics is in development with ASN and SSE
-- Funding for students to attend stand-alone meeting in MX; should we fund more students with partial support (meaningful level), or fewer with full support; majority vote to support more students but at a meaningful level. Consider proportional support based on anticipated costs
-- Formal proposals to pursue new programs are requested
