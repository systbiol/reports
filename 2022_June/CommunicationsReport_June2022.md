# SSB Communications Director's Report

### Communications Director: Jeremy Brown (2022-2024)

## Communications Director Transition

I started my term as Communications Director on January 1, 2022.

## Membership Summary

As of 5 June 2022, we have 668 total members.  Below is a summary of the current membership database.

**Membership Category**|**Number**|**Change From June 2021**
-----|-----|-----:
Life members|57|+6
Current Regular Members|318|-30
Current Student Members|226|-76
Current Editorial Board|51|no change
Current Emeritus Members|16|+5
Current Total Members|668|-95

There was a brief outage of our membership registration site (run by Burk) just before the extended early registration deadline for Evolution. The problem was fixed quickly, but this is a popular time for new registrations, so some people may have joined another society (SSE or ASN) to secure the discounted rate for meeting registration. Overall lower meeting attendance may also explain this change in membership numbers.

## Email Newsletters

Since starting, I have sent three email campaigns to our members via MailChimp. Two more are planned during Evolution. Below are the URLs for each of these:

- [January 12th, 2022](https://mailchi.mp/bbb494bb0e93/award-naming-discussion) -- A statement signed by the President, Past President, and President-Elect concerning the tone of the discussion surrounding the proposed change to the name of the Ernst Mayr Award.
- [May 15th, 2022](https://mailchi.mp/93937defe4f6/evolution_2022_and_more) -- A general update advertising the Evolution meeting, announcing the election, advertising open Program Director positions at NSF, and announcing the 2023 SSB stand-alone meeting in Mexico City.
- [June 5th, 2022](https://mailchi.mp/ee3c4a64bc2b/climate-survey-results) -- Disseminating the results of the tri-society climate survey.
- A fourth email will announce the SSB members' business meeting on Sunday.
- A fifth email is planned during Evolution 2022 to announce the results of the election and award winners.

Please let me know if there are things you would like announced or sent to SSB members via email. I plan to heavily advertise the standalone meeting in Mexico City later this year.

## Social Media Accounts

SSB maintains three social media accounts:

- Twitter: [@systbiol](https://twitter.com/systbiol) (~10,300 followers; ~5% increase)
	- Twitter is the most active of our social media channels and has been used this year for regular updates, announcements, and reminders. The Diversity Director now also has direct access to this account and is able to tweet announcements from the DEI Committee.
- Facebook group: [Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SocietySystematicBiologists/) (~5,000 members; unchanged)
	- Earlier this year, we made the decision to change the moderators for the SSB Facebook group. Now, moderation is handled by SSB officers with the intention of formalizing it as a channel for official Society communications.
- Instagram: [Systematic Biologists](https://www.instagram.com/systematicbiologists/) (139 followers; unchanged)
	- This account was started by the graduate student representatives a few years ago, but has been fairly inactive recently.

## Website Updates

Earlier this year, I began updates to the website to improve organization, fill in missing data, add updates, etc. The Legacy Committee has also recommended a series of changes to the site to better reflect the history of SSB. Given the extensive nature of these edits, they have offered funds for me to hire a graduate student assistant for the remainder of Summer 2022 to expedite these changes.

## Communications Committee

In January, we discussed the intention to form a Communications Committee, although this has not happened yet. I would like to begin forming this committee in the second half of 2022. My hope is that the committee can work together to develop a comprehensive communications strategy, collate all important announcements and updates from across SSB (Awards, Programs, DEI, etc.), and maintain regular activity on all communications channels.

## Elections

I worked with Burk to run the 2022 election. The election just closed and results will be announced shortly.

## Miscellaneous Activities

- Coordinating with organizers of the Mexico City meeting
- Helping to solicit nominations for the next graduate student representative
- Maintaining updated membership lists and fixing membership errors
- Providing feedback on official statements
- Helping to advertise SSB workshops and symposia at Evolution

## New Membership Options

Tracy Heath and Brant Faircloth began to discuss new membership options in 2021, but none of these options were implemented before I started. The major hurdles deal with payment and accounting, so I will aim to discuss this with Rob Clayton in the second half of 2022. The new options discussed include:

1. A way to provide "gift" memberships. This will enable anyone to buy a membership for someone else, like a lab member or something.
2. A way for members to donate to a fund that will provide free or reduced cost memberships to potential members for whom the dues are a barrier. In particular, individuals living in places where credit cards are not something many people have, those living in developing countries, students, etc.
3. Alternative payment options, like Paypal.
