## Email Newsletters

So far since I assumed control of the Communications email address in March, we have sent 7 email communications to members or recently lapsed members. Emails are now sent by The Rees Group using Constant Contact. Prior to January 2024, we sent email communications using MailChimp. We will attempt to maintain the URLs for all previous MailChimp communications for archiving purposes and are working on preservation of Constant Contact emails.

- June 16th, 2025 -- Evolution cheat sheet including: 
	- Reminder of major SSB events: IDEA award, Past-Presidential Address, Sponsored Symposium
	- Reminders of talks by DEIC travel awardees and Mayr sudents
	- Reminders of other events: DEIC headshots, business meetings.
- June 10th, 2025 -- Student representative elections.
- May 23rd, 2024 -- One day reminder about end of voting in SSB election
- May 19th, 2024 -- One week reminder about end of voting in SSB election

Going forward, I'll be looking to be on a more regular schedule for monthly updates to keep the Society in the forefront of members' minds. Planned monthly newsletters for 2025 are as follows:

- July: Celebration! 
	- A letter from President Dr. Jessica Ware.
	- Announcement of Dr. Bob Thomson as EIC.
	- Publisher's award winners
	- Mayr Award winners

- August: Call for reviewers, reminder of awards that get reviewed throughout the year
	- Also a more in-depth profile of our Mayr winners to motivate people to sign up and review.
- September:
	- Preview of the breakout meeting and announcement of registration
- October:
	- Call for self-nominations for positions that will become open
	- Explainer on what those positions do, and profile of the current holder
- November: 
	- More comprehensive overview of the breakout meeting
	- Call for any remaining volunteer positions for the meeting
- December: GSRA and Mini-Arts
	- Will put out a call to prior winners to highlight some neat papers funded by these.
	- Instructions for applications
	- Call for Reviewers

## Social Media Accounts

SSB owns five social media accounts:

- Twitter: [@systbiol](https://twitter.com/systbiol) (~10,700 followers) 
	- Twitter has fallen off considerably in engagement, often falling below a quarter of the engagement of Bluesky. Bluesky is now the dominant social media channel. The other Tri-Societies have left Twitter, and we have followed suit. 
- Mastodon: [@SystBiol@ecoevo.social](https://ecoevo.social/@SystBiol) (481 followers) 
	- The SSB Mastodon account was created in Nov. 2022, after many Society members left Twitter. Announcements made to this account mirror updates made to the Bluesky account. 
- Facebook group: [Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SocietySystematicBiologists/)
	- The SSB Facebook group was changed in 2022 to be moderated by Society leadership as an official communication channel.
- Instagram: [Systematic Biologists](https://www.instagram.com/systematicbiologists/) 
	- This account was started by the graduate student representatives a few years ago, but has been fairly inactive recently. I believe there is interest in making this account active again, but it is unclear who knows the login information. 
- Bluesky: [systbiol.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/systbiol.bsky.social) (1.1k followers) 
	- This account was established in 2024, as the Evolution meetings and many in the SSB community have moved to this platform. This is now the main social media channel for us.  
- My social media plan going forward is to have at least one post per week, more during high activity times. 
    - During June 9-13, for example, every day I will highlight one student who received one of our travel awards, with a link to their talk at Evolution 2025. 
    - Following the week of the July Celebration newsletter, I will be highlighting each of the various topics (Mayr Winners, IDEA award, Publisher's Award, New Council) MWF for the month after. 
    - In the weeks after the SSB 2026 schedule is public, I will be highlighting a workshop or sponsored event daily. 
	
# Social Media and Newsletter Wheelhouse
- For our discussion: promotion of members, activities, and events can be understood as endorsements of those activities. And failing to publicize these activities may be read as anti-endorsements. Thus, we should be fair in what we choose to publicize and have some consistent prioritization.
- My priorities are as follows:
	- Events and ongoings by us:
		- Announcements from Oxford University Press as they relate to the flagship journal and announcements from BSSB: Reshare via official channels.
		- Announcements from our committees: Reshare via official channels. 
		- Workshops fiscally sponsored by SSB: Reshare via official channels. 
		- Announcements from the annual Tri-Society meeting and the breakout meetings: Reshare via official channels.
	- Events and ongoings by actors other than SSB: 
		- Announcements from our partner Tri-Societies (Hamilton award, webinars, etc): Reshare where relevant to our members.
		- Announcements from national-level actors (NSF, NIH, UKRI, etc): Reshare where relevant to our members.
		- Non-profits (AIBS, etc): Discuss with President(s) and Executive VP before reshare.
		- Papers, workshops, talks, job postings via individual members: Do not reshare.

## Website Updates

I've made a number of updates to the website, and fixed broken links for awards and meetings. I'm currently moving forward with an update schedule so that sites are updated before calls for applications go live.

Scheduled updates are as follows:
- October: I will work with Nominations and the SSB Executive Vice President to prepare a list of society positions that will become open this year. I will update the Open Call for Positions Page. At this time, we can also update the calls for symposium and workshops page for the Evolution Meetings in collaboration with the Program Director.
- November: GRSA and Mini-Arts. I'll be working with the Awards director to ensure the application instructions are clear and complete on the website.
- December: I will work with the Program Director to update the Mayr instructions in preparation for the opening of the award competition.

## GitHub Repositories and Archive

As those in this role have done before me, I have continued to update our repositories on GitHub that contain various historical archives, including SSB Council membership, Executive Committee positions, Constitutional amendments, meeting minutes, and office reports.

I think we should consider adding meeting minutes to this repository. We should also discuss a non-public GitHub repository for the non-shareable reports.


## Miscellaneous Activities

- Interacting with SSB members who have questions, concerns, and comments about their memberships or the Society generally.
- Working with The Rees Group during this year's transition to establish new practices for communications (in progress).
- Coordinating with other members of the Executive Committee (particularly Awards) to announce deadlines and decisions.
- Working with SSB Student Representatives, particularly on elections and events.

## Priorities Going Forward

My major priority is developing a more scheduled approach to the communications throughout the year.
