# SSB JMC Report - (prepared by Josef Uyeda)
## 1. This year’s meeting---Evolution 2025, Athens, GA, June 20-24
1. 1,177 registered attendees for the in-person meeting
2. Virtual meeting attendance
    * 250 registrants for the Virtual Only option 
    * A total of 581 people logged in to watch at least one full talk. 
3. We are projecting a surplus of $70,000. 
4. However, that surplus accounts for the $299,543.14 that was carried forward from the 3rd Joint Congress in Montreal, which was very well attended and had higher than expected returns. 
5. This means that Athens came in below what is necessary to be sustainable, with future meetings being of major concern (see below).
6. We are seeking an Assistant Meeting Officer to start in the Summer 2025 for the Evolution 2026 meeting in Cleveland. 

## 2. Future Meetings
1. 2026 Cleveland, Ohio, June 20-24
    * Assuming projections from Athens are correct, the break even point for Cleveland would be 1000-1200 attendees (i.e. cost-neutral with same attendance as Athens meeting).
2. 2027 San Juan, Puerto Rico, June 25-29
3. 2028 - Tacoma, WA extended the deadline with a right of first refusal, need to decide. 
4. We are anticipating the need to increase registration costs and balance lower attendance numbers. Concerns of low attendance at future conferences, including factors such as high attendee costs (e.g. 2027 in PR).

## 3. Input needed
1. Major concern is how future meetings may be impacted by funding cuts, decreased international travel to the US, and increasing costs. Important to anticipate potential short-falls and make decisions that allow the meeting to be scaled back to reduce costs and become cost-neutral, regardless of attendance. 
2. Organizers view Tacoma as the best option for 2028 and conference center is flexible in how it can be adapted to generate a cost-neutral meeting for different attendance levels. 
3. Holistic future vision for the Virtual Meeting. 
    * Opportunity to increase diversity and global participation. At least two Mayr speakers could not come to the in-person meeting. 
    * Virtual meeting likely to become more important if fewer people can make in-person meeting.
    * Proposal for regional hosts to highlight work in systematics in regions that have lower participation with the annual meeting. 
5. This is the first year that the JMC used a rubric to decide on future locations rather than a “ban list”. A location scouting report using the new rubric for the 2028 conference is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0ejz6biollt3ove8wt2vw/2028-Location-Scouting-Report.pdf?rlkey=4zyzx6o4foemi078zmvzyns90&st=ujcwlb27&dl=0). 
    * Rubric seems to strike a good balance but can’t be applied thoughtlessly.
