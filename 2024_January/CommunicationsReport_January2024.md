## Code of Ethics Constitutional Amendments Vote

In Fall 2023, we held a vote on [constitutional amendments](https://github.com/systbiol/docs/pull/9) related to the new Code of Ethics. The vote was 88% in favor and 12% opposed, so these constitutional amendments will take effect at the time of the 2024 full Council meeting, held in conjunction with the 3rd Joint Congress on Evolutionary Biology in Montreal.
