HISTORY OF CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS
----------------------------------

A temporary Constitution was adopted at the first meeting of the Society of
Systematic Zoology on 29 December 1947. A permanent Constitution was adopted at
the first Annual Business Meeting on 12 September 1948 (published in Society of
Systematic Zoology News Letter, No. 3, November 1950). A series of
constitutional changes were approved by the Council and published in the News
Letter (No.4, April 1951); they were approved by the membership in 1951 (Syst.
Zool. 1:39, 1952).

Further actions concerning the Constitution are as follows (volume, page, and
year for Systematic Zoology/Biology is provided for modifications reported in
the journal):

1966: revised Constitution approved (16:105, 1967).

1969: amendments (19:313-314, 1970) approved (19:311, 1970).

1971: amendment (20:475, 1971) on incorporation approved.

1973: amendments (22:208-209, 1973) approved (23:302, 1974).

1976: amendments (24:403-405, 518-519, 1975) approved (24:518-519, 1975).

1983: updated Constitution published (32:103-106, 1983).

1984: numerous amendments approved (34:251, 1985).

1985: updated Constitution published (34:254-258, 1985).

1990: amendments on Society and journal names approved (40:251-252, 1991).

1991: updated Constitution published (40:386-390, 1991).

1997: amendments on committees (46:770, 1997).

2001: amendments on Article IV, VII, extensive amendments to Bylaw 6, creation
of bylaw 7, and renaming of bylaws 7-15 to 8-16. (2001).

2004: Constitution added to the Society Website in July 2004.

2007: amendments to the Constitution proposed via electronic ballot April 2007
concerning the renaming of Secretary, Awards Chair, and Program Chair, changes
related to January start date for officers, and spelling and wording
simplification throughout. Approved by the membership May 2007 and posted on the
website in June 2007 <www.systematicbiology.org>.

2008: three amendments to the Constitution were proposed via electronic ballot
March 2008: 1) a statement was added under "Article IV. Officers" to read, "or
until a successor is elected to that office" to match the description of
officers terms elsewhere and to allow officers to be replaced if two-thirds of
the council decides that the officers are not functioning effectively; 2)
"ARTICLE VIII. NOMINATIONS AND ELECTIONS"- Wording was added to match the
current practice that the nomination committee is appointed by the president
elect, and that the president heads the nomination committee following the
annual meetings; 3) "Bylaw 9. Initiatives and Long-Range Planning Committee"-
Wording has been added to extend each term to five years to ensure greater
continuity necessary for long range planning; this was requested by the
executive committee at their March 08 meeting. These changes were approved by a
majority of members voting electronically March-May 2008 and placed on the
Society website in June of 2008.

2015: Constitution put under version control at GitHub along with other documents (Feb. 16, 2015). See https://github.com/systbiol/docs. Amendments to Article IV (section 5) and Article V (section 2) made to add Communications Director and Graduate Student Councilors. Bylaws 9-16 renumbered to 10-17 in order to add a new Bylaw 9 (Presidents' Award Committee).

2016: Added Bylaw 18 defining the role of the Communications Committee and Communication
Director.
