# SSB Communications Director's Report

### Communications Director: Tracy Heath (2019-2021)

## Membership management under Burk & Associates

In January of 2019, Burk & Assoc. took over the management of SSB's membership. While the transition hasn't been seamless, there are several significant improvements compared to membership management under OUP. 

* B&A have given access to the real-time membership database to the Communications Director and the Awards Director. This streamlines our efforts to communicate to members and verify membership of award applicants. 
* With access to the database, I have worked to correct some of the issues that were apparent to me--for example there were a few members who had multiple current memberships (most likely because of the challenges of changing your contact information with OUP), we notified them and allowed them to extend their current membership or give the second membership to someone else. I think it will be useful to review the database on an annual basis. 

## Executive council communication

We are currently still using GSuites to manage communication within the executive council. These are the active `systematicbiologists.org` emails:

* president@systematicbiologists.org -- Cecile Ane
* vicepresident@systematicbiologists.org -- Dean Adams
* eic@systematicbiologists.org -- Bryan Carstens
* awards@systematicbiologists.org -- Felipe Zapata
* treasurer@systematicbiologists.org -- Noah Reid
* robclaytoncpa@systematicbiologists.org -- Rob Clayton
* programdirector@systematicbiologists.org -- Dave Weisrock
* communications@systematicbiologists.org -- Tracy Heath
* admin@systematicbiologists.org -- Tracy Heath

Overall the use of GSuites works well and the hand-off as new officers start their terms is easy. Rob Clayton now has access and the charges are directly charged to his offices. There have been some issues related to the names associated with the email addresses, which might be worth discussing among the EC. 

## 2019 Election

### Student Representative

The student representative election should have been held prior to the end of the year in 2018. Unfortunately, this didn't happen, so we had to hold the election in February. Because of the timing, I created the ballot in Qualtrics and sent anonymous links to every student member. This worked out ok, but it would be ideal if this election was managed by Burk. I also think it would be good to ensure that the ballot is available by the end of November. This will mean soliciting nominations in October and working with Burk to put together the ballot. We negotiated the cost of administering elections with Burk, but this did not include the student election, so we may have to set this up separately.

Our current student representatives are:

* Sam Church (until December 31, 2019)
* Kinsey Brock (until December 31, 2020)

### General Election

The ballot for the 2020 council and president elect was approved by the executive committee at the end of February. I then worked with our service representative at Burk to create an online ballot and a plan for the administration of the election. The ballot was opened on April 4, 2019. Unfortunately, due to some miscommunication, anyone that renewed their membership or joined after this date was not added to the ballot database. We didn't quite realize this until the ballot closed on May 21, 2019. Because of this, the Executive Committee decided to reopen the ballot for 10 days to make it possible for everyone to cast a vote. For the future, we will need a protocol for updating the ballot database to ensure that everyone has access even if they join SSB after the initiation of the election.

The results of the 2019 Election:

* 2020 President Elect: Laura Kubatko
* General Council for January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022: 
	* Micahel Landis
	* Jessica Light
	* LÃºcia Lohmann
	* Katherine Marske
	* Rosana Zenil-Ferguson
* The members voted to _approve_ the constitutional amendments to add an elected Joint Meeting Committee (JMC) representative officer as part of the Executive Council; and to rectify an omission of the Treasurer in the list of Executive Council members. These changes have now been [merged into the SSB constitution](https://github.com/systbiol/docs/commit/2454f1ea5b86d6be7faf9e1f45ed06091940e45e).
