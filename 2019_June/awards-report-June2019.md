## Overview

This report provides details on each of the awards managed by the Awards Director and Awards Committee.  

## Award Committee Members

Executive council approved that postdocs could be part of the awards committee. Melissa DeBiasse accepted the invitation; I did not hear back from other postdocs I contacted.

## [2018 Mini-ARTS Awards](https://www.systbio.org/mini-arts-awards.html)

The 2018 Mini-ARTS competition was announced soon after Evolution 2018. We received 33 submissions but unfortunately because of our busy schedules, we could not complete processing this award until March 2019. We awarded 12 proposals for a total of $23,950.00. Rob Clayton is currently helping us with the disbursements.

## [2019 Mayr Award](https://www.systbio.org/ernst-mayr-award.html)

We received about 50 applications, but only 16 qualified for the Mayr competition. A panel of 5 external reviewers and the Awards Committee selected 10 talks, listed below.

A different panel of 4 judges (already arranged) chaired by Melissa DeBiasse will attend all the talks and choose the winner. I will notify the current president (Cécile Ané) and the winner to ensure that the student is acknowledged at the SSB presidential address. We are handling

## [2019 Graduate Student Research Awards](https://www.systbio.org/reviewer-guidelines-gsra.html)

The GSRA were not announced in the spring as usual and likely won't be announced this year. There are three main reasons for this: a) we were a bit delayed with miniARTS and there was significant overlap between these two awards on top of our busy schedules, b) budget questions (see below), and c) administrative support constraints for the awards committee (see below).

If we open the application now it will overlap with 2019 mini-ARTS. Summer is not ideal for competitions because many SSB members are doing field work. In addition, finding enough reviewers would be extremely challenging. I think we should not open this competition this year, only open the mini-ARTS in the fall, and organize everything for the 2020-GSRA competition in the spring.

## Budget

It is not clear what is the annual budget for the awards committee. In previous years, we have guessed it and used the number of awards/amount as a guide for the current year. However, after we decided to use this approach for the 2018 mini-ARTS there was some discussion about how to proceed before announcing another award competition. While it is my understanding that we have a significant amount of cash in hand that we should spend, having an explicit budget might help the awards committee plan ahead of time the award announcements.

## Administrative Assistance

In a previous council meeting, there was a discussion on how much the administrative workload for this committee has increased over the years (mainly due to the number of awards given each year). Even though we have scripts to automatize many duties (thanks to Tracy Heath, previous Awards Director, who prepared those scripts 2 years ago), there are still many duties that require manual and tedious attention. For instance, checking membership for each of the applicants, setting up a website for application submission and letters of recommendation, assembling application packages (application documents plus letters of recommendation) in order to be distributed to reviewers, handling communications when application is incomplete, setting up a web-form to receive reviews from external reviewers (3 reviews per proposal)). Working with Burk to facilitate some of these duties would help streamline the work of the Awards Committee. For example, Burk could easily check applicant membership. In addition, a major current limitation is the web forms I have to create to receive applications and reviews. We have been using Google Forms, which is not accessible to some of our members (e.g., SSB students/reviewers based in China or other countries). Last year, Tracy Heath used Qualtrics through the Iowa State U license and it worked well. However, UCLA does not have a Qualtrics license and I had to go back to use Google. Additionally, the assembly of the proposal documents (match applicant with letter of recommendation, make sure application is complete, etc) is cumbersome (e.g., people don't follow guudleine and our scripts break). If Burk sets up a system like Qualtrics and handles all the receiving and assembling of the applications this could be a huge help to the awards committee. I got in touch with Heide Rohland on February 19, 2019 to discuss this but after a couple of back and forth emails I never heard back with a final proposal.

## Reviewers

### Reviewer Database

Finding enough reviewers for all the awards is extremely challenging. We have a database of reviewers that started 2 years ago but this database is old and out of date. In the awards committee we have discussed ways to create a more dynamic database but we don't have a good solution yet. One option is to ask Burk to include a tick box in the renewal/join membership form and ask if people would like to serve as reviewers. Alternatively, we can simply email SSB members (not students) directly and ask them to review proposals (i.e., making this one of the benefits (or costs) of being part of SSB).
