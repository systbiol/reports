## Fall 2021

Unfortunately, this fall was super challenging for me (Tracy) and I was unable to complete some of the things I had been working on as communications director. In particular, the new membership options for SSB. Hopefully this will be straightforward for Jeremy to tackle once he gets settled into this role.
