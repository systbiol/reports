## Email Newsletters

So far in 2024, we have sent 6 email communications to members or recently lapsed members. Emails are now sent by The Rees Group using Constant Contact. Prior to January 2024, we sent email communications using MailChimp. We will attempt to maintain the URLs for all previous MailChimp communications for archiving purposes.

- July 16th, 2024 -- Student representative elections.
- July 15th, 2024 -- General newsletter including:
	- Letter from President Corrie Moreau
	- Announcement of SSB's President's Award for Lifetime Achievement
	- Announcement of the Tri-Society IDEA Award
	- Update on 3rd Joint Congress
	- Announcement of SSB Early Systematist Awards
	- Announcement of SSB Election Results
	- Advertisement for SSB Mentorship Program
	- Description of new SSB membership management system
	- Link to Tri-Society Letter in Support of Collections
	- Call for new Evolution Meeting Organizer
	- Advertisement of SSB social media channels
- June 27th, 2024 -- Survey about SSB name change
- May 28th, 2024 -- Reminder about end of voting in SSB election
- May 9th, 2024 -- Announcement that SSB election is open

Going forward, I am hoping to work with Amy and the Rees Group to establish a standardized plan for regular SSB newsletters and other communications, as well as improve efficiency.

## Social Media Accounts

SSB owns five social media accounts:

- Twitter: [@systbiol](https://twitter.com/systbiol) (~10,700 followers)
	- Twitter and Mastodon are the most active of our social media channels. Twitter has been used this year for regular updates, announcements, and reminders.
- Mastodon: [@SystBiol@ecoevo.social](https://ecoevo.social/@SystBiol) (461 followers)
	- The SSB Mastodon account was created in Nov. 2022, after many Society members left Twitter. Announcements made to this account mirror updates made to the Twitter account.
- Facebook group: [Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SocietySystematicBiologists/)
	- The SSB Facebook group was changed in 2022 to be moderated by Society leadership as an official communication channel.
- Instagram: [Systematic Biologists](https://www.instagram.com/systematicbiologists/)
	- This account was started by the graduate student representatives a few years ago, but has been fairly inactive recently. I believe there is interest in making this account active again, but it is unclear who knows the login information.
- Bluesky: [systbiol.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/systbiol.bsky.social)
	- This account was established in 2024, as the Evolution meetings and many in the SSB community have moved to this platform.
