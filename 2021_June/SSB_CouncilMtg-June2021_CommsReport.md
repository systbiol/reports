# SSB Communications Director's Report

### Communications Director: Tracy Heath (2019-2021)

## Communications Director Transition

My term is ending in December and the SSB council elected Jeremy Brown as the next Communications Director. He will start officially on January 1, 2022. 

## Membership Summary

As of 14 June 2021, we have 763 total members.  Below is a summary of the current membership database.

**Membership Category**|**Number**
-----|-----:
Life members|51
Current Regular Members|348
Current Student Members|302
Current Editorial Board|51
Current Emeritus Members|11
Current Total Members|763

We saw an increase of 258 members since January of this year. This is likely attributed to registration discounts for the Evolution conference and award opportunities. 

### New Membership Options

I have been working with Brant Faircloth to develop new membership options. We have discussed some possibilities with Burk and are working on getting the details set up. The major hurdles deal with payment and accounting, so we will reach out to Rob Clayton to determine how to put these in place. 

1. A way to provide "gift" memberships. This will enable anyone to buy a membership for someone else, like a lab member or something. 
2. A way for members to donate to a fund that will provide free or reduced cost memberships to potential members for whom the dues are a barrier. In particular, individuals living in places where credit cards are not something many people have, those living in developing countries, students, etc. 
3. Alternative payment options, like Paypal. 

## Email Newsletters

Since my last report (early February 2020), I have sent 4 email campaigns to our members via MailChimp. The nice thing about MailChimp is that it allows you to evaluate the impact of your communications. Below are the URLs for each of the newsletters:

- [March 19, 2021](https://mailchi.mp/fb681965f713/solidarity-statement2021-2333465) -- A statement that was crafted by the diversity-equity-inclusion committees to show support for Asian and Asian-American members of our community in the wake of violent anti-Asian attacks. 
- [April 23, 2021](https://mailchi.mp/ef836f216ae9/ssb-update-april2021) -- A general update announcing the election, the 2021 IDEA Award Winner, and other topics. 
- [April 30, 2021](https://mailchi.mp/dc023b918929/bssb-launch) -- The official announcement of the launch of the _Bulletin of the Society of Systematic Biologists_.
- [June 7, 2021](https://mailchi.mp/e5929301831a/eic-nomination) -- Announcement calling for nominations for the next Editor-in-Chief of Systematic Biology.
- [June 14, 2021](https://mailchi.mp/1999a301e8b5/ssb-awards-update2021) -- Announcements from the SSB Awards Committee. 

Please let me know if there are things you'd like announced or sent to SSB members via email. I am planning a new newsletter in July.
