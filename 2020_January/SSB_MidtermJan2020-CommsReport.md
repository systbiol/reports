# SSB Communications Director's Report

### Communications Director: Tracy Heath (2019-2021)

## Membership Summary

As of 19 January 2020, we have 570 total members.  Below is a summary of the current membership database (as of 19 January 2020 at 12:45 PM).

**Membership Category**|**Number**
-----|-----:
Life members|40
Current Regular Members|264
Current Student Members|200
Current Editorial Board|51
Current Emeritus Members|15
Current Total Members|570
Membership Expired in 2018|368
Membership Expired in 2019|260

SSB has 185 fewer members than our total in November of 2019. This is a predictable decline since many of our SSB members wait until they register for the conference to renew. Unfortunately, by delaying membership renewal, expired members do not get to participate in the elections, receive updates about activities, etc. Thus, I will be sending an email to all the expired members notifying them of the upcoming election and other activities of SSB. 

Because of the switch from OUP to Burk for member management, much of the information about the history of our membership is not available to us. Burk has been extremely helpful in providing access and information to the membership database and hopefully this will now allow the SSB council to monitor and assess the status and history of our membership. I will be taking regular snapshots of our membership database to enable this. 

## Elections

In 2019, we contracted Burk to manage the general council elections. This worked well and we will use these services again for 2020. The nominations committee are currently assembling the ballot. Once this is complete, it will be sent to the general council for approval. We hope to have the ballot sent for voting by the SSB members before the end of March (though this will depend on Burk). 

### Student Council Elections

The SSB Student Councilors for 2019--Sam Church and Kinsey Brock--solicited nominations for the new student representative to replace Sam as his term ended on December 31, 2019. Kinsey advertised for nominations via twitter, evoldir, and an email to the membership. 

The Communications Director is responsible for administering the student elections. Since the ballot was assembled late in the year, we were a bit delayed getting it sent to the student members because of the holidays and the SSB conference. The elections is currently underway and will close on Jan 23, 2020. For this election, I created the ballot using my university's Qualtrics account (this enables sending anonymous ballots to individual emails). Unfortunately, this is does not seem like a sustainable approach since the future communications director may not have access to a service like Qualtrics. I will be discussing the possibility of Burk managing the student elections going forward. This will mean, however, that the nominations for the student councilor will happen around the same time as the general elections. There was some hesitancy to do this previously because that would mean that the student would be elected 7-8 months before their term started. I don't think this is a problem and it seems perfectly reasonable for the student-councilor-elect to participate in some of the activities that our student representatives organize. 


## Email Newsletters

In 2019, I sent five email newsletters to our members via MailChimp. The nice thing about MailChimp is that it allows you to evaluate the impact of your communications. Below are the URLs for each of the newsletters:

- [April 19, 2019](https://mailchi.mp/03ee331ffac1/ssb-spring2019-newsletter) - Provided information about Evolution 2019 activities, the graduate student representatives, the council election, ad hoc funding, SSB 2020, and a call for workshops and symposia. (Sent to 531 members, opened by 46% of recipients) 
- [May 28, 2019](https://mailchi.mp/81d13dd9d9ef/ssb-2019-ballot-update) - Notified members of the ongoing election asking them to cast their votes. (Sent to 554 members, opened by 67% of recipients)
- [June 19, 2019](https://mailchi.mp/c31843613cb5/ssb-evol2019-update) - Highlighted activities and events for the upcoming Evolution Meeting and announced election results. (Sent to 568 members, opened by 69% of recipients)
- [September 10, 2019](https://mailchi.mp/8895e9b2252e/ssb-evol2019-update-2032025) - Asking members to volunteer to review SSB awards applications. (Sent to 601 members, opened by 69% of recipients)
- [November 19, 2019](https://mailchi.mp/855cfea0ad6c/ssb-fall2019-update) - Soliciting nominations for council and president, as well as student representatives; highlighted SSB 2020; notified members to renew. (Sent to 639 members, opened by 63% of recipients)

I do think that these emails are relatively effective. Because MailChimp provides a static URL for every campaign, I am also able to tweet these links and post them on Facebook. For specific messages, like the request for awards reviewers, this did generate a good amount of response. 

If any member of council has thoughts on other things to include in these semi-regular mailings, please let me know.


## Social Media Accounts

SSB maintains three social media accounts:

- Twitter: [@systbiol](https://twitter.com/systbiol) (8,747 followers)
- Facebook group: [Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SocietySystematicBiologists/) (~3,000 members)
- Instagram: [Systematic Biologists](https://www.instagram.com/systematicbiologists/) (92 followers)

This year, I hope to work on a set of guidelines for the SSB social media accounts. I think this will be helpful for future communications directors and student councilors so that they can create and curate content and followers. 

## SSB Student Representative Activities

The activities of the student representatives are primarily coordinated by the Program Director. However, there are some things that are quite relevant to communications and I will report them here. 

- Meeting SWAG: The students have taken the lead in creating items for distributing at the conferences. These include stickers and iron-on patches. Because the patches are such a popular item at the meeting, the students will be creating a "limited-edition" SSB patch each year. 
- Instagram Profiles: The students have created a portal for other SSB student members to provide information about their research and lives so that they can be featured in an Instagram post on the [Systematic Biologists](https://www.instagram.com/systematicbiologists/) account. So far there have been two students featured.

## Item for Discussion

I would like to assemble a committee to help with SSB communications. In particular, it would be good to have other SSB council members contributing content via the social media accounts (Twitter and Facebook). For this committee, I would like to include both of the student representatives and one or two other members of council.
