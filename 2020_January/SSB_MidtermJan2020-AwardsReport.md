# SSB Awards Report - January 2020

## Awards Committee
* Committee member and Awards Director: Felipe Zapata (awards@systematicbiologists.org)
* Committee members: Emily Jane McTavish, Akito Kawahara, Melissa DeBiasse, Hannah Owens.

## Overview

This report will provide details on each of the awards managed by the Awards Director and Awards Committee.

## Award Committee Members

Given the heavy load and multiple obligations of all members of the awards committee, we recruited one more member to join the committee, Dr. Hannah Owens.

## Administrative Assistance

After the last midyear meeting, the awards committee has been looking for solutions to support awards administration and reduce the work load of the Awards Director (AD) and committee members. During the fall of 2019, Felipe Zapata (AD) met (online) with 3 groups who have developed tools to support administration and review of applications and awards for other societies. In previous emails discussions, Felipe has explained the rationale for awards administration support and the in-house solutions that have been implemented in the past. Here are a _few_ key points describing the kind of administrative support that would reduce the work load of the AD and committee members significantly:

* A platform to receive and assemble all applications that is accessible anywhere (e.g., Google Forms does not work in China, Qualtrics require a paid license, etc). This means a mechanism to automatically receive documents sent independently by the applicant and recommender and match them seamlessly. Currently our scripts work well, but people don't follow rules of file naming, use of web form, and we do this by hand. It may sound easy, it is not.
* A mechanism to facilitate contacting potential reviewers. We have a database of people who have indicated they could review proposals, and in 2010 we implemented the "suggested reviewers" box to the applications. Once contacted, facilitate decisions about Conflict of Interest by masking everything in the proposal except name/title/institution. Facilitate distribution of assembled proposals-LoR-budget to assigned reviewers. Contact reviewers regularly to remind about reviews. As an example, the AD has sent about 650 emails (sometimes personalized to answer specific questions of reviewers, etc) in the last month for the current Graduate Student Research Award. This has represented a significant amount of time.
* A platform to provide access to reviewers of the assembled application for download or online reading.
* An automatic mechanism to receive and assemble the reviews (each proposal is reviewed by at least 3 external reviewers). Then, an easy platform to allow the committee go over the reviews, review the proposals, make sure the reviews are professional/editable, request a new review if needed, etc. Email/Slack comments in Google Spreadsheets have worked but a platform with all the documents easily accessible would be way better. In addition to the review itself, a mechanism to facilitate summarizing the scores, review the rankings, etc. Our current scripts work OK but require hand-holding.
* Not critical, but really helpful, interface with membership database.

If a reasonable and easy-to-use application/review system were in place, the AD could balance the work load and focus on other duties of the position, including but not limited to, lead the Awards Committee, coordinate the award announcements, discuss budget, perform reviews, provide details for how to receive funds, respond to universities with letters on "official SSB letterhead" about overhead policies, etc.

The AD received quotes from 3 organizations:

* Rob Brandt and Heather Cacanindin: Rob has been hired to write a platform to support awards for SSE (Society for the Study of Evolution) and BSA (Botanical Society of America). The platform is, in many ways, also an "in-house" solution tailored to the specific needs and way to conduct reviews in those societies. Rob has indicated they would be willing to explore changes to their platform to suit our needs. It is not clear how much they will charge us for this, but in the meeting they mentioned "a small investment" to buy in the system (to be honest they were not super clear and they did not provide a detailed quote; the best guess is that the investment would be in the low thousands). It seems the bulk of the system has already been implemented. One potential downside is that this is almost like a side job for Rob and there is no certainty there will be stable support in the long term, etc.

* [Submittable](https://www.submittable.com/): a company dedicated to produce a web platform for all sort of applications, reviews (including manuscripts), competitions, etc. The AD distributed via email copies of quote I got from them. The total for a 2 year contract was $21,150, including support, training, and most (if not all) the utilities we would need. Highly customizable. The con: the cost. The pros: in addition to be a system developed specifically for administration of applications and reviews, they have support 24/7 and (perhaps) longterm (it's s startup).

* [SCORES](https://spars.aibs.org/who-we-are.html) a system developed by [AIBS](https://www.aibs.org/home/index.html) to support applications and reviews for academic societies and groups. The system is very similar to Submittable and it has also most (if not all) the utilities we would need. Highly customizable. The cost for year 1 is $37,136 and $29,369.50 for year 2. The big con is the high cost. The con: the cost. The pros: in addition to be a system developed specifically for administration of applications and reviews, they have support 24/7 and (perhaps) longterm (unclear but if this is associated to AIBS and AIBS and other societies are using it, very likely longterm).

A decision about this (either positive for one option or negative for all options) needs to be reached soon. All three companies are waiting to hear back from SSB.

## [2019 Mayr Award](https://www.systbio.org/ernst-mayr-award.html)

A panel of 4 judges chaired by Melissa DeBiasse evaluated the 10 talks competing for the 2019 Mayr Award. The winner for 2019 was [Sandra √Ålvarez-Carretero (Queen Mary University of London)](https://www.systbio.org/ernst-mayr-award.html). 

For 2020, we expect the usual number of applications (about 40) and we will proceed in the same way as in previous years to choose 10 talks. 

## [2019 Graduate Student Research Awards](https://www.systbio.org/graduate-student-research-awards.html)

After the midyear meeting, the council approved to run the GSRA in the fall because we were too late with the miniARTS-2018, which happened in spring 2019 instead of fall 2018. Based on the GSRA 2018, we decided to increase the maximum award to $3000 for 2019 and hopefully fund the same number of proposals this year (about 40% in 2018)

We received 92 completed applications in November 2019.  We are still in the middle of the review process. For most proposals we were able to recruit 3 reviewers, but for some proposals we only have 1 or 2 reviewers. The AD continues sending emails directly to potential reviewers and reminding confirmed reviewers about the forthcoming deadline. The target deadline to get all the reviews back is January 30. After that date, the committee will process the reviews and hopefully within a few weeks announce the winners. 

## [2020 Graduate Student Research Awards](https://www.systbio.org/graduate-student-research-awards.html)

We hope to announce the 2020 competition late in spring 2020 (late April).
