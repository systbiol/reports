# SSB Communications Director's Report

### Communications Director: Tracy Heath (2019-2021)

## Membership Summary

As of 3 July 2020, we have 676 total members.  Below is a summary of the current membership database (as of 6 July 2020 at 9:18 AM CDT).

**Membership Category**|**Number**
-----|-----:
Life members|46
Current Regular Members|332
Current Student Members|234
Current Editorial Board|49
Current Emeritus Members|15
Current Total Members|676

SSB has 79 fewer members than our total in November of 2019. I expect the membership to increase slightly since the GSRA applications were recently opened. Hopefully by the end of the year, we will have membership at a similar level to last year. 

I spent some time in early May sorting out some residual membership issues from the transfer between OUP to Burk. In particular, there were some life members that were dropped from OUP's member rolls and then got lost in the transition. I believe that we have corrected all of these issues, but it is difficult to tell. If anyone knows of people who think they are members, but have not been receiving the SSB emails or election ballot, please let me know. 

### Topic for Discussion

One topic that has come up several times since I have been on council is the development of membership options that enable people to purchase guest memberships or donate to SSB via the membership portal. It seemed as though this was difficult to do through OUP. Additionally, for some countries, paying for membership using a credit card may present a barrier. I have had some emails with our Burk representative and she thinks they can create ways for some of these things. The exact mechanisms for this need to be discussed, however. For example, she was concerned about guest memberships and privacy. But it may be possible to purchase a membership for someone that they would then have to activate (i.e., like a gift certificate). We may also consider a donation option to a fund that provides free membership to individuals for whom the cost is a barrier to joining. This would require developing a way for potential members to request a membership fee waiver or adjustment. It is time to really consider how to make membership more accessible, and thus reaching more systematists in the Global South. 

## 2020 Election

### Student Representative

The student representative election was opened a little later than we had hoped. This year we will try to conduct the election before the end of the year. The current student representatives will be recruiting nominees after the ECR^2 events. Ideally, we would still like Burk to handle the elections. It does make sense to have them do this separately from the general elections since only students are allowed to vote for the student councilor. 

Our current student representatives are:

* Kinsey Brock (until December 31, 2020)
* Luke Campillo (until December 31, 2021)

### General Election

The ballot for the 2021 council and president elect was approved by the executive committee in February. I then worked with our service representative at Burk to create an online ballot and a plan for the administration of the election. The ballot was opened on April 20, 2020. Everything ran very smoothly this year. If anyone renewed or joined the society after the ballot was opened, they were given access within a few days and sent an email about the vote. I do worry, however, that not everyone sees the emails from Burk or social media posts announcing the election. This is because as of May 6, 2020, we had 652 members and only 170 people voted in the election (which closed on May 20, 2020). I will communicate with Burk about ways to get the word out better for future elections.

The results of the 2020 Election:

* 2021 President Elect: Brian O'Meara
* General Council for January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2023: 
	* Jeremy Beaulieu
	* Becky Chong
	* Lauren Esposito
	* Brant Faircloth
	* Claudia Sol√≠s-Lemus
* The members voted to _approve_ the change to the constitution to update the name of one of the SSB awards, changing the Mini-PEET to the Mini-ARTS. These changes have now been [merged into the SSB constitution](https://github.com/systbiol/docs/commit/0e527db4db1223d0739c4478984d2c5835b6039b).


## Email Newsletters

Since January of 2020, I have sent 5 email campaigns to our members via MailChimp. The nice thing about MailChimp is that it allows you to evaluate the impact of your communications. Below are the URLs for each of the newsletters:

- [January 29, 2020](https://mailchi.mp/eca46748863b/ssb-public-policy) - A letter from Erika Edwards announcing the SSB Public Policy Award. (Sent to 576 members, opened by 60% of recipients) 
- [March 16, 2020](https://mailchi.mp/68f8d3dd673d/ssb-update-march2020) - A newsletter announcing that Evolution 2020 was canceled and some other COVID-19 related topics. (Sent to 613 members, opened by 66% of recipients)
- [April 28, 2020](https://mailchi.mp/4893097d9050/ssb-editor-survey-apr2020) - A letter from Bryan Carstens with a survey for members requesting feedback on the new journal. (Sent to 643 members, opened by 75% of recipients)
- [June 3, 2020](https://mailchi.mp/f610d2c4c4c4/solidarity-statement) - The email sent from SSB to speak out in solidarity with those protesting anti-Black racism and police violence. This statement was approved by council. (Sent to 648 members, opened by 55% of recipients)
- [July 3, 2020](https://mailchi.mp/dddc6a701479/ssb-update-july2020) - A newsletter updating members about the ECR^2 virtual events, promoting the fund raiser inspired by Scott Edwards' cross-country bike ride, and announcing the GSRA. (Sent to 670 members, opened by 50% of recipients)

If any member of council has thoughts on other things to include in these semi-regular mailings, please let me know. I wouldn't mind increasing the frequency a bit. I plan on sending one next month to announce the election results.


## Social Media Accounts

SSB maintains three social media accounts:

- Twitter: [@systbiol](https://twitter.com/systbiol) (9,133 followers)
- Facebook group: [Society of Systematic Biologists (SSB)](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SocietySystematicBiologists/) (~3,600 members)
- Instagram: [Systematic Biologists](https://www.instagram.com/systematicbiologists/) (115 followers)

In the midyear meeting we discussed a bit about how to improve SSB's communication through the Facebook group, which is not very active. I still don't have a plan for doing this since I am not a fan of the platform. Since admins of the group must approve posts by members, I find that I am not allowing many through. Many of the Facebook group members are clearly spamming science-related groups with posts to get people to like/join some other group. SSE has a Facebook organization page (https://www.facebook.com/sse.evolution) in addition to a community group. This makes a clearer distinction about what is coming from the society and what is more of a community bulletin board. 

In the midyear meeting, the executive council approved the formation of an ad hoc communications committee. I have not gotten around to doing this because the last 6 months have been challenging. I hope to have some time at the end of the summer to make a plan for an ad hoc committee for the rest of my term.
