**SSB Midterm report on Joint Meeting Council Activities**

Prepared by Kelly Zamudio (JMC representative for SSB)

December 16, 2017

***Meeting Venues Upcoming Years***

Next year (2018) we will have a joint meeting with ESEB in Montpelier
France (Aug 18-22), and in 2019 we meet in Providence, RI.

Looking forward. No changes since our meeting in Portland. Still in
negotiations with Cleveland and Albuquerque for upcoming meetings.

***Talk Formats at the Montpellier Meeting***

The advertisement for submission of symposia and talks for the ESEB
joint meeting continues. Deadline for abstract submissions is Jan 15,
and you must submit to up to 2 specific symposia. Brian sent out a
detailed set of instructions to SSB membership and we will aim to send
out another reminder right after the holidays. We all need to double
down on social media efforts to get SSB members to submit talks by
January 15.

***Safe Evolution Efforts***

The code of conduct committee, composed of Andrea Case (SSE), Brian
O'Meara and Kelly Zamudio (SSB), and Gina Baucom (ASN), has been working
on formalizing our code of conduct, enhancing our reporting system,
retaining a safety officer, and promoting the message of no tolerance
for inappropriate behavior at the meetings. Brian and I can fill you in
on our activities and plans for the next 2 months.

***Monies left over from Brazil Meeting***

We ended up with an unexpected \~\$20K excess from the Brazil meetings,
which the Brazil organizers returned to the JMC and requested that we
somehow invest in facilitating attendance of Brazilian students/post
docs at future meetings. JMC decided to table this until our full
meeting in Montpellier, so we could discuss the best way to distribute
travel awards/advertise etc.
