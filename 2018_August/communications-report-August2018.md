# SSB Communications Summary - August 2018

In January 2018 Brian O'Meara stepped down at SSB Communications Director, and I (Emily Jane McTavish) was elected Interim Communications Director, through Dec 2018. Tracy Heath has been elected communications director and will serve Jan 2019 - Dec 2021

## SSB google suites accounts
   - Subscribed to Google suites on behalf of Society of Systematic Biologists
   - Made accounts for all execs:  
        * accounts are $5 per account per month and have only been adopted by Awards and Comms.  
        * Should we just allocate on an as needed/as requested basis?  
 
## Membership
   - I have to email the OUP membership person each time I need an updated membership list, and it often takes them several days to get it to me.  
   - I get lots of complaints regarding membership
       * wasn't able to register
       * wasn't able to determine if registered
       * can't update email address with OUP
       * am a member and am not on the lists (e.g. missing some but not all lifetime members, last year's Mayr award winners, Systematic Biology AE's, and some other current members)
  - Will transition to new  member management be soon?

## Email lists
  - Getting current list of members is problem due to the membership management issues listed above.
  - Mailing large groups:  
     * Even with google suites, with the new accounts, it isn't possible to BCC more than 500 people in an email.  
     * Right now we are under 1,000 members total, so I only need to send 2 emails, so it isn't crazy annoying but it is a bit of a pain.  
    Alternate options include:  
     - Google group or mailing list model  
     - Is it even important that we only email members? Maybe that is only necessary for elections.
       * We could have a mailing list that includes all members
       * This could actually increase membership, as more folks would hear about awards etc., and stay in contact with the community beyond voting members.
  - Traffic level:
     * We are generally pretty quiet. Do we want to contact our members more?
     * Some regular newsletter?

## Website
  - Website is hosted on Weeby
     * PRO easy to use graphical interface
     * CON no version tracking. An unknown number of people have access, and there is no regulation or record of who changes what.
  - Some overlap and conflict with OUP journal site - list of AE's should probably be removed from society site, other old info should be purged as well.
  - The systbio.org domain has been owned by a former member since 2004, and was expiring.
  - As of July 1 I switched it over to NameCheap. It is currently registered to me (Emily Jane), associated with the communications@systematicbiologists.org email address
     * *I didn't set a credit card for it to autorenew. Needs to be updated by July 1 2019*
     * Move to Weebly would make sense if we are keeping the site hosted there, but wasn't possible due to a weebly bug.


## Elections
  - Used my institutional (UC Merced) qualtrics account for elections, which enforces a 1 registered email address 1 vote process. Although the elections emails were bounced by a few mail servers, I sorted those out.
  -  I think this process was largely successful. Incoming director Tracy Heath also has campus access to qualtrics. I recommend continuing to run elections this way.  
  - OUP's ineffective membership management was also problematic in elections. Several people who should have been included were not on the rolls, and therefore were not sent ballots
  - There had been some discussion in past about encouraging campaigning, but this didn't seem to occur
  - 671 members were sent ballots, and 226 responded

## Twitter
 - @systbiol twitter account participated in two large scale campaigns, #DarwinDay and #500queerscientists, both of which had very positive responses
 - Otherwise mostly stuck to re-tweeting tweets about papers published in Systematic Biology
 - Twitter followers grew from 6,120 in Jan 2018 to 7,267 Aug 1 2018


## Facebook
   - The SSB facebook group is a closed group, but I started accepting every request to join. No spam or ill effects thus far.
   - Membership has grown from 1,862 members in Jan. 2018 to 2,011 Aug 1 2018
   - The group is largely quiet, with minimal discussion and majority of posts being mildly self-promotional sharing of workshop and conference announcements.
   
## Agenda items:
  - Opt in vs. opt out for exec @systematicbiologists.org email addresses?
  - Maintin a broader mailing-list than just membership?
