# SSB Awards Report - August 2018

## Awards Committee

* Committee member: Emily Jane McTavish

## Overview

This report will provide details on each of the awards managed by the Awards Director and Awards Committee.  


## Award Submission Procedures

I have been using a mix of Google Forms and Qualtrics forms for SSB awards applications. Iowa State has a license for Qualtrics and this service is nice for collecting applications, particularly when a file--e.g., proposal or letter--must be uploaded. I think something like this must be used for future applications. This is because it provides easy ways to download and organize the materials, and it overcomes some of the major limitations of Google Forms. 

Google Forms are problematic for two main reasons that relate to accessibility. First, and foremost, Google is not available in China. There are numerous biodiversity researchers in China and it will be important to consider the possibility of more future members residing there and if they are able to access SSB's online portals and content. Second, Google Forms require the applicant to log in with a Google account in order to upload a file. 

## Reviewers

### Reviewer Guidelines 

I have created a page on the SSB website that describes the guidelines provided to reviewers for the three major SSB awards:

[https://www.systbio.org/reviewing-award-applications.html](https://www.systbio.org/reviewing-award-applications.html)

We feel that this information is very valuable to both the reviewers and applicants, making the process of much more transparent to everyone involved. 

### Reviewer Database

In addition to the reviewer guidelines, the Awards Committee has released a form for members of our scientific community to volunteer to be a reviewer for SSB's grants and awards. Since publicizing the database, we have had 65 responses. This has been incredibly helpful and allowed us access to a more diverse pool of reviewers.

### SSB Thank You Letter

In 2017 I was asked by a reviewer for the GSRA to write a "thank you" letter for their promotion and tenure file. I created a LaTeX file and SSB letterhead to send to volunteer reviewers to acknowledge their efforts helping us select awardees. 


## [2018 Mayr Award](https://www.systbio.org/ernst-mayr-award.html)

This year, the Ernst Mayr Symposium will take place at the Evolution Meetings in Montpellier, France. The organizers of the conference required that the Mayr Symposium consist of 14 talks instead of 10 talks as with previous conferences. The awards committee felt that this was a good opportunity to attract more applicants from outside of North America. 

This year, the format of the meeting required all talks to be submitted to pre-selected symposia. Thus, the Awards Committee received the abstracts in the same way as other symposium organizers. We received 52 abstracts, a much larger number than in my previous years as Awards Director. The abstracts were reviewed according to the [guidelines described on the SSB website](https://www.systbio.org/reviewer-guide-mayr-award.html).  

The panel and Awards Committee selected 14 talks, listed below. 
All of the selected speakers have confirmed their participation in the symposium. As of July 27, we are still recruiting judges for the Mayr symposium. This has proven difficult because so many members of our field have a scheduling conflict with multiple phylogenetics symposia concurrent with the Mayr.

The judges will view all of the talks and choose the winner. I will notify the current president (Susana) and the winner to ensure that the student is acknowledged at the SSB presidential address.

## [Travel Awards for International Student Members](https://www.systbio.org/travel-awards.html)

This year, we created an award for student members attending the Evolution Meetings to help defray the cost of travel. This award is only available to students traveling from a different continent and will provide up to $500 toward their expenses.

We received 29 applications for this award, and all students were highly deserving of the funds. Awardees were selected at random, with slightly higher weight given to applicants based on the following criteria: (1) presenting a poster or talk at the meeting, (2) member of a group underrepresented in systematic biology (self identified), (3) based at an institution in a country with a [low GDP](https://www.isi-web.org/index.php/resources/developing-countries). We selected 13 awardees and they were notified of the award. After discussing the process with Rob Clayton, this award is fairly easy to administer. Since it is less than $600, we only need to confirm their attendance at the meeting and give them the funds (maybe even while we are at the conference).

## [2018 Graduate Student Research Awards](https://www.systbio.org/reviewer-guidelines-gsra.html)

We received 92 completed applications, which is only 8 more than in 2017.
I had expected that we would see a much larger increase because we opened the award to PhD students in their 3rd and 4th years. 
Perhaps this is simply a lag and the submissions will increase as the community catches on.
 
Because I had a fairly busy spring semester, this award was announced a bit later and is still in process. We emailed 197 potential reviewers and were able to get 60 volunteers. 
These reviewers are currently evaluating the GSRA proposals and will complete the review by August 20, 2018. The reviewers are evaluating proposals based on the [guidelines](https://www.systbio.org/reviewer-guidelines-gsra.html) we have provided on the SSB website.

After the Evolution Meetings, the Awards Committee will process the reviews and announce the awardees. We hope to award 38-40 awards to match the funding rate for this program in 2017. 


## [2017 Mini-ARTS Grants](https://www.systbio.org/mini-arts-awards.html)

The 2017 Mini-ARTS competition was announced in October, with an application deadline of 30 November 2017. We received 33 submissions. Unfortunately, because the Awards Committee members all had very busy spring semesters, we did not finish processing this program until May 3, 2018. 

The proposals submitted to this program were reviewed according to the [guidelines](https://www.systbio.org/reviewer-guidelines-mini-arts.html) outlined by the Awards Committee on the SSB website.
With the help of our excellent panel of reviewers, we identified 9 excellent projects and the recipients are listed on the [Mini-ARTS page](https://www.systbio.org/mini-arts-awards.html).

## 2018 Mini-ARTS Grants

This award will be announced shortly after the Evolution Meetings. I hope to finish processing the proposals before the end of the year.

## Awards Director Transition Plan

Felipe Zapata was recently elected as Awards Director and will be taking over the position in January of 2019. As a member of the Awards Committee, Felipe has been heavily involved in helping to manage the awards. We will be meeting in November to go over all of the responsibilities of this position. At this time, I will also show him the scripts and other tools I have used for handling applications and reviews.
